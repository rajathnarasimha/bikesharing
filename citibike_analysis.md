# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 
This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data.
## Summary:
    The NYC citi bike data over the years tells us that it is possible to open the business in the Des Moines since this city has the same population growth over the years and has the same kind of weather like the NYC.
### Detailed Analysis:

    This section answers the question:
        What is the population of Des Moines? How does its population compare to the population of New York City? Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?

    1. The population of Des Moines:
        In 2017 it was 2,15,152
        In 2018 it was 2,16,582
        In 2019 it was 2,17,521

        The population of New York:
        In 2017 it was 81,75,133
        In 2018 it was 83,98,748
        In 2019 it was 19,500,000
    
        Population growth in NYC:
            1.027 percent growth from 2017 to 2018.
            3.32 percent growth from 2018 to 2019.

        Population growth in Des Moines:
            1.06 percent growth from 2017 to 2018.
            1.004 precent growth from 2018 to 2019.

    2. CitiBike users growth over the 3 years span in NYC:
        2017: 18,16,498
        2018: 19,77,177
        2019: 23,44,224

        1.088 percent growth in Citibike users from 2017 to 2018.
        1.186 percent growth in Citibike users from 2018 to 2019.

        This data shows us that as the population increases the citibikers count increases periodically.

    3. Citibike Customers and Subscriber count growth over the span of 3 years in NYC:
        2017: Customers= 2,58,059 Subscribers= 15,58,439
        2018: Customers= 2,73,721 Subscribers= 17,03,456
        2019: Customers= 4,43,865 Subscribers= 19,00,359

        As it can be interpreted from the data, the number of subscribers and customers increased significantly as the population increased.
